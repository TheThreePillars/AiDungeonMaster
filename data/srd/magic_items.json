      "description": "This helm functions like a helm of brilliance but is lower-powered. Instead of the standard helm’s allotment of gems, the lesser helm has 10 diamonds (fireball, 10d6 damage, DC 20 Reflex half), 20 corals (flaming sphere), 30 garnets (scorching ray), and 40 agates (light). It still glows near and harms undead, has the flaming weapon ability, and provides fire resistance (though only 20 instead of 30). Just like the standard helm, the wearer risks detonation; diamonds become fireballs centered on the wearer, corals become flaming spheres in and adjacent to the wearer’s space, garnets become scorching rays that fire randomly at creatures in range, and the agates and helm are destroyed.",

The goat can travel for a maximum of 1 day each week—continuously or in any combination of periods totaling 24 hours. At this point, or when the command word is uttered, it returns to its statuette form for no less than 1 day before it can again be used. The Goat of Travail: This statuette becomes an enormous creature, larger than a bull, with the statistics of a nightmare except for the addition of a pair of wicked horns of exceptional size (damage 1d8+4 for each horn). If it is charging to attack, it may only use its horns (but add 6 points of damage to each successful attack in that round). It can be called to life just once per month for up to 12 hours at a time. The Goat of Terror: When called upon with the proper command word, this statuette becomes a destrier-like mount with the statistics of a light horse. However, its rider can employ the goat’s horns as weapons (one horn as a +3 heavy lance, the other as a +5 longsword). When ridden in an attack against an opponent, the goat of terror radiates fear as the spell in a 30-foot radius (Will DC 16 partial). It can be used once every 2 weeks for up to 3 hours per use.",

The steed allows itself to be ridden, but if the rider is of good alignment, the steed is 10% likely per use to carry him to the lower planes and then return to its statuette form. The statuette can be used once per week for one continuous period of up to 24 hours. Note that when an obsidian steed becomes ethereal or plane shifts, its rider and his gear follow suit.

Once per round, the wearer may add an enhancement bonus of +1 to +5 on one attack and damage roll for an unarmed strike or natural attack (for one specific attack, not all attacks made with an unarmed strike that round). The wearer may use this item an additional time per round when his BAB reaches +6, +11, and +16. Choosing to enhance an unarmed strike is not an action and may occur when it is not the wearer’s turn (such as when making an attack of opportunity). The wearer must decide to use the item before the attack roll is made, but does not have to expend all uses at the same time. For example, if the wearer can use the item twice per round, he can use it once on his turn when making an attack and save the second for the possibility of making an attack of opportunity. Additionally, the bodywrap can grant melee weapon special abilities to a creature’s unarmed attacks, so long as those special abilities to be added apply to unarmed attacks. See Table: Melee Weapon Special Abilities for a list of abilities. Special abilities count as additional bonuses for determining the market value of the item, but do not modify attack or damage bonuses. Any special abilities are set at the time of creation. A bodywrap of mighty strikes cannot have a modified bonus (enhancement bonus plus special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +7. Unlike an amulet of mighty fists, a bodywrap needs to have a +1 enhancement bonus to grant a melee weapon special ability.",

Bracers of armor surround the wearer with an invisible but tangible field of force, granting him an armor bonus of +1 to +8, just as though he were wearing armor. Both bracers must be worn for the magic to be effective. Alternatively, bracers of armor can be enchanted with armor special abilities. See Table: Armor Special Abilities for a list of abilities. Special abilities usually count as additional bonuses for determining the market value of an item, but do not improve AC. Bracers of armor cannot have a modified bonus (armor bonus plus armor special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +8. Bracers of armor must have at least a +1 armor bonus to grant an armor special ability. Bracers of armor cannot have any armor special abilities that add a flat gp amount to their cost. Bracers of armor and ordinary armor do not stack. If a creature receives a larger armor bonus from another source, the bracers of armor cease functioning and do not grant their armor bonus or their armor special abilities. If the bracers of armor grant a larger armor bonus, the other source of armor ceases functioning.",

This effectively grants the Craft Construct feat to anyone using the manual to craft a golem of that type, and it provides an increase in caster level for the purpose of meeting the prerequisite to craft that specific type of golem. Further, the manual grants a +5 competence bonus on skill checks to craft the golem and contains all the necessary spells, which can be activated by anyone who has the relevant spells on their class’s spell list (but only for the purpose of crafting the golem). When using a golem manual, you must still spend the normal amount of time to craft the golem and pay the cost of the golem’s body (or provide it through other means), but you do not need to pay the rest of the normal cost to create the golem. The spells included in a golem manual require a spell trigger activation and can be activated only to assist in the construction of a golem. The cost of the book does not include the cost of constructing the golem’s body. Once the golem is finished, the writing in the manual fades and the book is consumed in flames. When the book’s ashes are sprinkled upon the golem, it becomes fully animated. For example, with a clay golem manual, you would need to provide a body worth 1,500 gp (rather than the normal full cost of 21,500 gp), spend 42 days constructing the golem’s body (1 for each 1,000 gp in the normal price of the golem), have a caster level of 9th or higher (as the manual provides a +2 bonus and the normal requirement is 11th level), have animate objects, bless, commune, prayer, and resurrection on your class’s spell list, and succeed at a DC 16 Craft (sculptures) or Craft (pottery) check (but the manual gives you a +5 bonus on the check.)

Once that occurs, the owner instantly knows the powers of the prayer beads and understands how to activate the strand’s special magical beads. Each strand includes two or more special beads, each with a different magic power selected from the following list. Special Bead Type Special Bead Ability Bead of blessing Wearer can cast bless. Bead of healing Wearer can cast his choice of cure serious wounds, remove blindness/deafness, or remove disease. Bead of karma Wearer casts his spells at +4 caster level. Effect lasts 10 minutes. Bead of smiting Wearer can cast chaos hammer, holy smite, order’s wrath, or unholy blight (Will DC 17 partial). Bead of summons Summons a powerful creature of appropriate alignment from the Outer Planes (an angel, devil, etc.) to aid the wearer for 1 day. (If the wearer uses the bead of summons to summon a deity’s emissary frivolously, the deity takes that character’s items and places a geas upon him as punishment at the very least.) Bead of wind walking Wearer can cast wind walk. A lesser strand of prayer beads has a bead of blessing and a bead of healing. A strand of prayer beads has a bead of healing, a bead of karma, and a bead of smiting. A greater strand of prayer beads has a bead of healing, a bead of karma, a bead of summons, and a bead of wind walking. Each special bead can be used once per day, except for the bead of summons, which works only once and then becomes non-magical. The beads of blessing, smiting, and wind walking function as spell trigger items; the beads of karma and summons can be activated by any character capable of casting divine spells. The owner need not hold or wear the strand of prayer beads in any specific location, as long as he carries it somewhere on his person. The power of a special bead is lost if it is removed from the strand. Reduce the price of a strand of prayer beads that is missing one or more beads by the following amounts: bead of blessing –600 gp, bead of healing –9,000 gp, bead of karma –20,000 gp, bead of smiting –16,800 gp, bead of summons –20,000 gp, bead of wind walking –46,800 gp.",

      "description": "A lord’s banner is a cloth flag or standard, typically at least 2 feet wide and 4 feet long (though some are up to twice that size), meant to be carried and displayed on a lance, polearm, frame, or staff. It has no effect when not mounted properly or when laying on the ground. It normally depicts the insignia or heraldic symbol of a particular noble. A lord’s banner may be carried (on foot or mounted) or planted. In the latter case, the banner does not need a bearer, but if it is toppled or touched by an enemy, it loses its effectiveness until reclaimed and replanted by allies of its owner. Crusades: A noble-looking lord’s banner of crusades emits a hallow effect in a 40-foot radius around it, so long as it is borne by one true to the religion of the person whose crest is on the banner (these sorts of banners usually have a holy symbol or other religious insignia worked into the design). The banner displays the faith’s holy symbol along with the owner’s crest. Swiftness: A group or army that are traveling under a lord’s banner of swiftness can make a forced march without needing Constitution checks or suffering any nonlethal damage from doing so, allowing them to cover great distances while still arriving ready to do battle. This ability affects all allied creatures within 1 mile as long as they are able to see the banner at least once a day. Terror: Enemies of the bearer of a lord’s banner of terror, while within 30 feet and able to see the banner, must make a Will saving throw (DC 16) or become panicked, fleeing as quickly as possible for as long as they can see the banner. Those that succeed on the save are shaken. A creature that makes its saving throw is immune to the banner’s effects for 1 day. Victory: Allies of the owner of a lord’s banner of victory gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saves, and skill checks for as long as they can see the banner.",

When carried close to the body of a creature continuously for 1 week, the gem harmlessly absorbs a portion of that creature’s life essence. If separated from its bearer for at least 1 day, the gem loses this attunement. If the bearer gains one or more negative levels, the black soul shard absorbs one of these negative levels into itself, negating the effect. The black soul shard can only absorb a negative level if carried by the person it is attuned to. If an attuned black soul shard is used as an additional focus component for raising the attuned creature from the dead, the negative level cost of being raised is one less than normal (minimum 1), but only if the spell is cast within 24 hours of the creature’s death. Absorbing a negative level (whether from an attack or raising the attuned creature from the dead) destroys the portion of the soul within a black soul shard. This does not harm the creature, but requires re-attuning the gem for another week for it to function again. A creature can only have one black soul shard attuned to it at a time.",

      "description": "This tattered white canvas banner looks like an old piece of sailcloth, or perhaps a winding shroud—a 4-foot-by-6-foot rectangle with loops that can fit over a spear haft or pole running up one side. If mounted on a longspear or pole at least 8 feet in length, the banner shifts in appearance to match the heraldry or coat of arms of the person who attached it. If that person has no device, the flag instead displays a device that echoes the owner’s personality (such as a favorite animal, favored weapon, or holy symbol of the wielder’s deity). When carried into battle, a banner of the ancient kings confers several benefits. As long as the longspear or pole to which the banner is attached is firmly wielded in two hands, its carrier gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Initiative checks. In addition, when so wielded, it grants the wielder and all allies within 30 feet a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws against mind-affecting effects. If the carrier of the banner fails a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect, he may attempt a new saving throw against that effect every round he continues to wield the banner of the ancient kings—once he releases his firm grip on the banner’s haft, though, he no longer gets this benefit, even if he wields the banner properly at a later point while still under the effects of the mind-affecting effect. If the banner’s carrier possesses the Flagbearer feat, the banner of the ancient kings doubles the morale bonuses granted by that feat. A bard who carries a longspear or pole to which a banner of the ancient kings has been attached is treated as four levels higher than his actual bard level for the purposes of determining the bonuses granted by his inspire courage bardic performance ability.",

Crafted from bronze, brass, or countless other semiprecious metals, these miniature bells — no more than an inch tall — hang from delicate chains or short silken cords and ring with a tinny tinkling. Typically affixed over doorframes or to precious objects, when rung frequently these ornaments supposedly ward off gremlins and protect those nearby from ill fortune. And unlike most such folk magic, expertly made gremlin bells actually work. Gremlin bells have two uses. First, they irritate gremlins. Any gremlin that comes within 20 feet of a gremlin bell cannot make use of any of its supernatural abilities and becomes uncomfortable, typically seeking to leave the area (though it is not compelled to do so). Secondly, once per day a gremlin bell can be purposefully rung. All gremlins within 20 feet who can hear the chime must make a DC 16 Will save or be sickened for the next 5 minutes.",

Technically, the creature from whom the brain was harvested is dead, but as long as the brain remains in the cylinder, the creature can continue to think. Dials on the cylinder’s side control whether the brain can see, hear, or speak using a raspy speaker built into the cylinder’s surface. The brain can speak and understand any languages it knew in life, and retains the use of the following skills at the values it possessed while alive: Appraise, Bluff, Diplomacy, all Knowledge skills, Linguistics, Perception, and Sense Motive. It retains no other abilities it possessed in life, including purely mental abilities. The mi-go typically preserve humanoid brains in this grisly manner when they wish to interrogate a creature at a later date, or when they wish to preserve a creature as a resource for consultation or research purposes. A brain cylinder is usually made of dark metal and has hardness 10 and 30 hit points—cylinders made of other materials might have higher or lower hardness scores and hit point totals. If a brain cylinder is destroyed, the brain within is lost. Likewise, if the creature from whom the brain was harvested is restored to life, the brain within the cylinder is destroyed, and only powerful effects capable of building entirely new bodies can restore to life a creature that has had its brain removed. Note that the gp price to create a brain cylinder only accounts for the basic creation—the brain of a particularly knowledgeable creature could be worth far more than 5,000 gp to some buyers, especially if the information contained in the brain is of a particularly sensitive nature.",

She also gains a +5 sacred bonus on Knowledge (planes) checks regarding outsiders with the good or evil subtypes, and any effect she creates with the good descriptor takes effect at +1 caster level. A crown, an orb, and a scepter of heaven—collectively known as a regalia of heaven—increase in power when used together. If the wearer of a crown of heaven wields an orb or scepter of heaven, effects she creates with the good descriptor gain an additional +1 caster level, and she gains a +1 sacred bonus to AC and on saves against attacks or effects created by evil creatures. She also radiates an aura of menace in a 20-foot radius. Any evil creature within this aura takes a —2 penalty on attack rolls, on saving throws, and to AC until it successfully hits the wearer of the regalia (DC 20 Will negates). A creature that saves is immune to this effect for 24 hours. If the aura is dispelled, the wearer can restore it as a standard action. If the crown is worn while the wearer is wielding both an orb and scepter of heaven, the crown’s caster level increases to 15th, effects the wearer creates with the good descriptor gain an additional +1 caster level increase, and her sacred bonus to AC and saves increases to +2. In addition, as a full-round action, the wearer can create an aura of sanctity for as long as she concentrates. This aura provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, as well as the benefits of a magic circle against evil and a lesser globe of invulnerability. A crown of heaven bestows one negative level on any evil creature bearing it, which cannot be removed or overcome while carrying the crown. If the same creature carries an orb or scepter of heaven, it gains one additional negative level per object. An evil creature intentionally donning a crown of heaven gains an additional negative level and is affected as bestow curse (DC 17) immediately and every 24 hours that the crown is worn. A neutral character can attempt a DC 17 Fortitude save to avoid gaining these negative levels.",

      "description": "A chime of opening is a hollow mithral tube about 1 foot long. When struck, it sends forth magical vibrations that cause locks, lids, doors, valves, and portals to open. The device functions against normal bars, shackles, chains, bolts, and so on. A chime of opening also automatically dispels a hold portal spell or even an arcane lock cast by a spellcaster of lower than 15th level. The chime must be pointed at the item or gate to be loosed or opened (which must be visible and known to the user). The chime is then struck and a clear tone rings forth. The wielder can then make a caster level check against the lock or binding, using the chime’s caster level in place of her own. The DC of this check is equal to the Disable Device DC to open the lock or binding. Each sounding only opens one form of locking, so if a chest is chained, padlocked, locked, and arcane locked, it takes four successful uses of a chime of opening to get it open. A silence spell negates the power of the device. A brand-new chime can be used a total of 10 times before it cracks and becomes useless.",

One face bears one of the seven ancient runes representing magic and sin, while the opposite side bears the image of a broken column. When carried, a whispering coin periodically haunts its carrier with soft whispers that seem to be in an ancient language, but which are never loud enough to understand. These whispers are only slightly distracting, and in fact offer a boon to the carrier of the coin— they grant a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws against spells of the school of magic associated with the coin’s rune (the coin found in this adventure bears the rune of lust, and thus grants a +1 resistance bonus against enchantment spells). Once per day, when the bearer flips the whispering coin and asks a question in the same ancient language while the coin is in the air, the coin provides an answer to the question as it lands, either “yes” (the rune) or “no” (the broken column); the word “yes” or “no” is also whispered into the user’s ear as the answer is determined. A whispering coin’s knowledge is limited to events that have a significant chance to affect the coin’s carrier in the immediate future (no further out than a few minutes), and is further limited to facts, not conjecture. You could ask a whispering coin whether a door you were about to open is trapped, but not “Is the king the mastermind of the conspiracy we just learned about?” The GM, in other words, can determine whether or not a whispering coin can answer or not—if the coin can’t answer, it spins on its edge upon landing for several seconds before flopping over to a random side and does not whisper a “yes” or “no” into the user’s ear.

      "description": "A Devil’s Crux is a cunning puzzle box that, when closed, contains an interior space far larger than its exterior would suggest. A Devil’s Crux appears to be a 6-inch-diameter wooden-and-metal dodecahedron (similar in shape to a d12). Each of the crux’s 12 surfaces is carved with a different shape or rune, and when an observer looks at the item, she has the unsettling sensation that too many sides can be seen at once. Shaking or rolling the box reveals that it is hollow, as objects within rattle and shift (though no amount of shaking can damage the objects within). In order to open a Devil’s Crux, a person must trace the outlines of these runes and images with the tip of a finger in the proper order. Each time one is traced in the correct order, it glows with a soft red light, but whenever one is traced out of order, the runes flash brightly; this burns the person attempting to open the crux and causes all faces to deactivate, forcing the opening process to start anew. Failure to open a crux eight times in a row causes the box to randomly establish a new activation order. A character can attempt a DC 35 Disable Device check or a DC 25 Intelligence check to try to open the puzzle box. Each attempt takes 1 minute, and the check can be retried with a cumulative +1 bonus on the roll, to a maximum bonus of +7, after which the crux resets its order (at this point, the bonus reverts to +0 and the character must start anew). Failure on either of these checks causes the crux to flash with fire and deals 2 points of fire damage plus 2 points for each previous failure to the character (Reflex DC 15 half); the amount of damage resets to 2 if the activation order is reset. A Devil’s Crux can be forced open with a successful DC 28 Strength check or destroyed through physical damage (hardness 10, hp 30). If a crux is forced open in either of these ways, it explodes into a 10-foot-radius burst of fire, dealing 3d6+6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 15 half) to all creatures and objects within the burst, including any objects held within the crux. If forced open or destroyed, the crux crumbles to ashes, and any objects it contained fall to the ground at the site of the fiery burst. When opened properly, the crux unfolds into a 2-foot square flat sheet of metal and wood. Any objects the crux contains sit on the center of the sheet. An unfolded crux automatically folds up again as soon as a character attempts to bend any of the sheet’s four corners (a move action). The crux automatically folds up around any objects that sit upon its face at this time—objects that would exceed the crux’s capacity are pushed gently aside by the refolding action. Once a particular crux’s combination is known, a character can open it automatically with 3 consecutive full-round actions. A Devil’s Crux can hold up to 200 pounds of objects. As an object that creates an extradimensional space, a Devil’s Crux functions as a bag of holding for the purpose of determining how long a living creature within can survive, or what happens when the box is placed in another extradimensional object like a portable hole.",

If the attack hits, the needles pierce the victim’s wrists and ankles, causing the victim to become sickened for 1 round by the momentary flash of pain. In addition, the victim must make a DC 17 Will save to avoid being dominated by the crux, as if via dominate person. The needles immediately retract back to the crux an instant after they strike a foe, but if the victim has been dominated, the crux’s wielder can control its actions. Control lies with the crux, not the person who made the initial attack—passing the crux to another creature allows that creature to take control of the dominated humanoid. If the crux is given to the victim, the effect ends. The crux must be held in the user’s hand in order for the user to issue a new command to the victim. Otherwise, the domination effect caused by a marionette crux lasts for a day, but additional uses of the crux can effectively extend the effect over a victim indefinitely. A marionette crux can maintain domination over only one creature at a time—if a second humanoid is dominated by the crux, the previously dominated human is released from the effect immediately.

The wearer can shape objects with hardness 8 or lower (stone, wood, leather, and so on) as if it were soft clay. While it’s possible to rapidly make crude shapes (shaping roughly 1 cubic foot of material per round), creating fine detail or moving parts requires additional time and an appropriate Craft check, at the GM’s discretion. Materials with more than 8 points of hardness are still affected, though not so dramatically. The wearer may treat these materials as having half as much hardness when attempting to damage or reshape them. For instance, a steel bar normally has 10 points of hardness, but the wearer of the gloves may treat it as having hardness 5, and shape it with woodworking tools. The gloves only affect shaping materials with the wearer’s hands or handheld tools, and only when the wearer desires to do so.",

Once implanted, the soulbound eye allows the master to observe the world around the wearer through the wearer’s senses. It also allows for telepathic communication between the wearer and the master. Neither of these features function across planar boundaries. The soulbound eye’s wearer is not compelled to obey its master’s telepathic commands, but the master can use the soulbound eye as a conduit for hold monster, modify memory, pain strike, or suggestion spells, treating the wearer as the target of the spell, no matter the distance between master and wearer. The victim is allowed any normal saving throws or spell resistance against spells cast through the soulbound eye.

      "description": "This small crude-looking drum is attached to a strap long enough to loop around the wearer’s neck. A successful DC 12 Perform (percussion) check activates the drum, which enhances any nearby natural or magical fire as long as the bearer spends a move action each round to continue playing. All fires (including fire spells and effects) within 30 feet of the player deal an additional 1 point of fire damage (or 2 points for the greater version). All unattended flammable alchemical objects such as tindertwigs, flasks of oil or alchemist’s fire, and fireworks within this range have a 10% chance of spontaneously igniting or exploding (as appropriate to the item) when the drum activates. This chance increases by 5% each round and is checked at the start of the performer’s turn as long as the playing continues. A greater goblin fire drum has all the above abilities and can create pyrotechnics once per day.",

Elite cultists typically imbibe deathgag elixir as part of an elaborate initiation ritual when they are promoted to high-ranking positions in the cult. Thereafter, should the imbiber fall below –1 hit point, the elixir triggers the release of a fatal poison that throws him into wild convulsions. The victim begins foaming at the mouth, and his eyes turn blood red. Soon after, the victim’s entire jaw dissolves, rendering him immune to speak with dead spells. Prior to the victim’s death, only a limited wish, miracle, or wish spell can undo the effects of the elixir. Individuals that have imbibed deathgag elixir are noted as being “deathgagged” in the Defensive Abilities section of their stat blocks.",

A creature with the fire subtype inside the area of the burst takes 5d6 points of damage and is stunned for 1 round — a successful DC 15 Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the stun effect.

The metamagic gems presented here are not the only such gems that exist. Other metamagic gems based on metamagic feats from other sources could easily be created—their costs should follow the pattern presented here (1,000 gp for gems that alter a spell slot by 1 level, 2,000 gp for those that alter spell slots by 2 levels, and so on), and each new gem should have a corresponding unique gemstone type associated with it.",

If a spellcaster holding the phantasmal gem casts an illusion spell with a duration of concentration (or concentration + a number of rounds), the illusion lasts up to an additional 10 rounds after the spellcaster ceases concentrating on it. The spellcaster may end the illusion early as a swift action. The phantasmal gem can be used multiple times in a day, but cannot grant more than a total of 10 additional rounds of illusion spells per day. A gnome using a phantasmal gem can recharge it by expending uses of spell-like abilities gained through the gnome magic racial trait. Each spell-like ability expended as a standard action recharges 1 round of duration to the phantasmal gem (up to a maximum of 10 rounds).",
